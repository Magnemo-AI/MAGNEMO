"""magnemo.yescheck — THE YES CHECK: the yes is a person's, and the engine can tell.

The verbs that decide what becomes memory (`yes` · `no` · `clear` · `promote`, their long forms `reject` and
`cleartaint`, and the answers inside `review`) run only when all of this holds:

  1. stdin is a terminal. An agent's shell has none.
  2. MAGNEMO_AGENT is not set. Every MCP server and every seat-run command carries one; a person's terminal does not.
  3. The process is not a child of an MCP server session the engine started.
  4. `--by` names a keyholder in the vault's `trust.humans`. A name that is not there is refused, never defaulted.
     With no `--by`, the first keyholder is used, and only once 1-3 passed.

A refusal is one line that names the gate and the route (the command to type, in the reader's own terminal), and one
line in the trust ledger (`judgment.refused`, with
`catch: yes-check` and `ran_by: refused:<reason>`). It is never silent. The MCP side is unchanged: promotion is not a tool.

ONE OVERRIDE, for a company's own close ritual: `MAGNEMO_YES_RELAY=<keyholder>` lets a terminal session that is not
the keyholder's own carry that keyholder's relayed word. It works only on a terminal, only for a name in
`trust.humans`, only for that name, and the ledger line reads `ran_by: relay:<who ran it>`, so a relay is never
mistaken for the keyholder's own hand. There is no other bypass.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT STOP, said plainly: a program that opens a terminal of its own, clears MAGNEMO_AGENT and names a
keyholder looks like a person to this check. The check stops the plain case, an agent running the command through
its shell tool, and makes every other case leave a line. An agent with your shell and your terminal is still you.
