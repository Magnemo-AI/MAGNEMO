"""magnemo.config — the vault's documented configuration file.

One JSON file per vault: `<vault>/_config/magnemo.json`. Created with
defaults on `cli init`; safe to hand-edit (it is the founder's file). Every
key is documented in docs/CONFIG.md. Unknown keys are preserved; missing
keys fall back to the defaults below, so a partial file is always valid.

Zero dependencies, deterministic: no environment lookups beyond the vault
path, no model calls, no clock reads.
