# Security

## Reporting
If you find a security problem in MAGNEMO, write to **hello@magnemo.ai** with what you found, how to reproduce
it, and what you think it lets someone do. Please do not open a public issue for it first.

You will get an acknowledgement within **72 hours**, and a plain answer on what we will do and when. We will
credit you in the release notes if you want that.

## In scope
- The engine (`magnemo/`): the CLI, the vault format, the ledgers, the guard, the chest.
- The MCP server (`magnemo-mcp`): the tools and the walls around them (staging only, partitions, scope; `keep` past a
  Sentinel hold or past the day's cap is a hole).
- The vault format itself: anything that lets an agent write past staging, alter the ledger, or launder taint.

## Out of scope
- Bugs in the agents or clients that talk to the server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop).
- Anything that needs the keyholder's own hand to go wrong (`magnemo yes` on a bad note is a review problem, not a hole).
- A process that allocates its own TTY, clears `MAGNEMO_AGENT` and names a listed person to run `magnemo yes`. That is known
  and written down in `KNOWN_LIMITS.md`: the yes check is a check on the hand, not a credential. `magnemo yes` with no TTY (an agent's tool call, a script, a
  pipe) is refused, with a line in the ledger.
- A model, or a client holding a door key, calling `keep` on a yes the person did not give. The engine cannot see the
  chat; that is written down in `KNOWN_LIMITS.md`. Such a keep is ledgered unverified, counts half, stops at the cap,
  and never clears a hold.

## What we promise about the software
Zero network calls, zero telemetry, plain files you own — `magnemo doctor` checks the first on every run. If you
can show the engine sending anything anywhere, that is the most serious report we can get.

There is no bounty yet. There is a thank-you, a fix, and your name on it if you want it.
