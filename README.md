# Magnemo

**Tools gave your agent hands. MCP gave it a nervous system. Magnemo gives it a brain.**

Magnemo is a memory for your AI, kept on your computer in plain files. Your AI writes down what it learns as it works; nothing becomes memory until you approve it, and every memory shows who wrote it and who approved it.

When your agent writes something down, Magnemo asks you in the chat. One click.

## The one paste
Open Claude Code in any of your project folders, and paste this. (Its `magnemo mount` step writes `.mcp.json`, the file Claude Code reads. In Cursor, Windsurf or another client, use the block for your client under "Install in your client".)

```text
Set up Magnemo in this project:
1. Install it: pip install magnemo. It needs Python 3.11 or newer. If pip can't find it, install uv (curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh) and then run: uv tool install magnemo
2. Initialize the vault: magnemo init
3. Register the MCP server: run magnemo mount — it writes this project's MCP config itself.
4. Verify: run magnemo doctor and confirm everything passes.
5. Then ask me to restart you, so Magnemo's tools load, and to say this when you are back: "Use Magnemo to remember what this project is."
If anything fails, show me what went wrong and fix it if you can.
```

After the restart, say it: **Use Magnemo to remember what this project is.** Your agent writes one line down, and
Magnemo asks you in the chat to approve it. One click. Then ask what it remembers.

**For builders.** Magnemo is an MCP server with four tools — `retrieve`, `stage`,
`bootpack`, `handoff` — and a CLI for your side: review, promote, reject.
It runs on your machine, in plain markdown files you own. The package imports no network
module (`magnemo doctor` scans for one on every run); the only traffic is `git push` to a
backup destination, if you add one. Every promotion is recorded with who wrote the entry,
the name given for the yes, when, and through which gate. Trust is computed from that
record, never asserted. It mounts beside any memory you already
run (a folder of notes, Obsidian, a RAG stack). Python 3.11+, zero dependencies,
Apache-2.0.

Fresh vault? THE CHARTER section will say it isn't promoted yet — that is the
governance speaking: Magnemo never fabricates canon. Stage a charter, review it,
promote it, and every boot thereafter serves it back verbatim.
(`magnemo` not found after install? pip's script folder isn't on PATH —
`python3 -m magnemo` always works.)

**Open beta — read [KNOWN_LIMITS.md](KNOWN_LIMITS.md) before trusting it with anything you can't lose.** Honest caveats, no fine print.

## Install in your client
One server, said ten ways. Every block below is the same thing: `uvx magnemo-mcp` with `MAGNEMO_VAULT` pointing at
the folder your memory lives in (make one with `magnemo init ./vault`). Tested on this Mac where it says so;
the rest is from each client's own docs and marked untested — corrections welcome, open an issue.

**Claude Code** — tested: a Claude Code session mounts the server, lists the four tools and calls them (last run
Oct 4, 2026: Claude Code 2.1.289, `magnemo-mcp` 0.6.7).
```bash
claude mcp add magnemo -e MAGNEMO_VAULT=/absolute/path/to/vault -- uvx magnemo-mcp
```
(`claude mcp list` shows `magnemo … ✔ Connected`. Add `-s project` to write it into the repo's `.mcp.json` for your team.)
Only have the desktop app? `claude` may not be a command in your shell. On a Mac the app keeps its own copy at
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code/<version>/claude.app/Contents/MacOS/claude`; run that in place of `claude`.

**Claude Desktop** — untested end to end here. Download the extension from the latest release —
[magnemo-0.6.8.mcpb](https://github.com/Magnemo-AI/magnemo/releases/latest) — and open it; Claude Desktop asks for the
vault folder and does the rest. (The connectors directory listing follows once it is accepted.)

**Cursor** — untested here (not installed on this Mac); the link and the block follow Cursor's docs.
[![Add to Cursor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cursor-Add_Magnemo-000000?style=flat-square)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=magnemo&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJtYWduZW1vLW1jcCJdLCJlbnYiOnsiTUFHTkVNT19WQVVMVCI6Ii9hYnNvbHV0ZS9wYXRoL3RvL3ZhdWx0In19)
Or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code / Copilot** — untested here; per VS Code's docs.
[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Magnemo-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22magnemo%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22magnemo-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22MAGNEMO_VAULT%22%3A%22%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fvault%22%7D%7D)
Or `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windsurf** — untested; `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cline** — untested; Cline → MCP Servers → Configure → `cline_mcp_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" },
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Continue** — untested; `~/.continue/config.yaml` (or a file in `.continue/mcpServers/`):
```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: magnemo
    command: uvx
    args: ["magnemo-mcp"]
    env:
      MAGNEMO_VAULT: /absolute/path/to/vault
```

**Gemini CLI** — untested; `~/.gemini/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** — untested; `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.magnemo]
command = "uvx"
args = ["magnemo-mcp"]
env = { MAGNEMO_VAULT = "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
```

**Zed** — untested; `settings.json` → `context_servers`:
```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "magnemo": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["magnemo-mcp"],
      "env": { "MAGNEMO_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

**After the install**, the loop is the same everywhere: your agent writes to staging, you review.
```bash
magnemo yes             # promote the top of the queue (yes <id-fragment> · yes --all)
magnemo no <id> --reason "…"   # reject one — the reason is required; rejections teach
magnemo review          # the interactive queue, when you want to read first
magnemo doctor          # python, vault, config, ledger, and the mount — scans the package for network modules too
```
Anything that speaks MCP over stdio mounts the same way. The remote door (ChatGPT and hosted clients) is on its way in 0.7.0.

## Agents draft, people keep — the one rule
Agents get four MCP tools. Promotion is not one of them.
The yes is yours: Magnemo asks you in the chat, and your answer never passes through the agent. [KNOWN_LIMITS.md](KNOWN_LIMITS.md) says what that does and does not stop; [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) has the clients it works in.

| Actor  | Door                | Can do |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Agents | MCP server (stdio)  | `retrieve` canonical memory · `stage` → **staging only, the one write tool** · `bootpack` on wake · `handoff` at the boundary |
| You    | CLI + git (any editor)| review the queue · **promote / reject** · edit anything · own everything |

## The vault
```
vault/
  dev/      knowledge/ playbooks/ decisions/ debt/        ← example: a dev team's partition
  ops/      knowledge/ playbooks/ clients/ decisions/ style/  ← example: an ops team's partition
  shared/   tickets/ changelog/                            ← interop bus (gated)
  _staging/   agent writes await review here
  _index/     machine-managed
  _ledger/    trust_ledger.jsonl — append-only, never forgets
```
Every note is markdown with provenance frontmatter (author, written, source,
status, reviewed_by, supersedes, strength). **Provenance is the file format.**

## Privacy
Your memory lives on your computer, in plain files you can open. No network calls of its own. Add a backup remote and it pushes there, nowhere else.
The precise version: the package imports no network module, and `magnemo doctor` scans for one every time it runs. If you add a backup destination, the engine runs `git push` to it. The full page: https://magnemo.ai/privacy

## Guarantees (Phase 1 — Governed Recall)
- Through the MCP server, agent writes NEVER reach canonical stores directly — staging only, always.
- Search returns canonical (promoted) notes only. Staged notes are not searched. The boot pack shows staged material marked as staged: the titles of open threads and of the top staged notes, and the last handoff's cut line with a pointer to its note.
- Partition walls enforced per agent (`MAGNEMO_PARTITIONS`); cross-partition = DENIED.
- Supersession is explicit: old notes archive with a forward link. Nothing deletes.
- Rejections are kept and recorded — rejections teach.
- Every promote/reject lands in the append-only Trust Ledger with actor + reason.

## Tests
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v     # incl. full MCP round-trips (legacy + four-verb)
# or: pip install -e ".[test]" && pytest
```
The same suite runs on every push, on Python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12: [the runs](https://github.com/Magnemo-AI/magnemo/actions/workflows/test.yml).
