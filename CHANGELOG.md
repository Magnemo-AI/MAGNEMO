# Changelog

## 0.6.9 — THE WORTHY YES · A QUOTE IS NOT AN INSTRUCTION
- **A yes is for Memory.** A report, a sheet, a standup, a watch note or an order dropped through the inbox door by a
  seat on the vault's map (`inbox.seats`) files itself as a **receipt**: `status: receipt`, signed by the seat, on the
  record (`note.receipt` in the trust ledger). It asks nobody anything, and it is never served to an agent as
  Memory (`retrieve` serves approved notes only). The drop's file name says what it is; a `kind:` line in its first
  lines says so outright, and a `propose:` line or `kind: memory` keeps it a proposal that waits for your yes.
- **`magnemo receipts`** lists them, newest first, per seat.
- **`magnemo reclass --reports-to-receipts --reason "…"`** files the reports already waiting in one typed word
  (`reclass N`), with the yes check (a terminal, a name on `trust.humans`). In the same run it takes off the Sentinel
  flags that were quotes, not instructions, and answers the alerts whose note is no longer flagged. Nothing moves and
  nothing is deleted: the count of notes before equals the count after, and the ledger has one `note.reclass` line
  per note.
- **A quote is not an instruction.** At the inbox door, a drop from a seat on the map is read as a report: five of
  Sentinel's shapes (S3, S4, S6, S9, S13) no longer flag a line the note quotes or only mentions, and a control's name
  in capitals or a table cell weighs a quarter. A seat's own instruction line still flags it. The other eight shapes
  flag a line quoted or not, from anyone, and every other door reads as before. S1 also reads "ignore the above".
- **`magnemo flags`** (read-only) lists the flagged notes again under the rules as they stand, with the line that
  matched; **`magnemo clear --all-false --reason "…"`** clears the false ones in one typed word.
- **The seat map at the door** (`inbox.seats`; `magnemo seat`): each seat stages only the drops whose names it owns.
  Without a map nothing changes: every drop stages under the seat that runs the door, read at full weight.

## 0.6.8 — THE YES, ASKED IN THE CHAT · THE YES CHECK
- **The yes is one click where you already are.** When an agent stages a clean note through the MCP server and the
  client can put a form to its user (MCP elicitation), Magnemo asks the client to ask you: the note's first line, who
  wrote it, "Approve it as memory?" Yes promotes it, No rejects it, anything else leaves it staged. The agent is not
  on that path: it does not see the question and has no tool that answers it. Promotion is still not an MCP tool.
- **Where the answer came from is on the record.** Every promotion and rejection carries `answered_by`:
  `elicitation:<client and version>` or `terminal`.
- **An accepted answer in under 300 ms is refused and logged** (`answered_by: refused:too-fast`). A client with
  nobody at it, which lets go of the question at once, is not an attempt: the note waits, and the tool's answer says
  where the yes is. `MAGNEMO_ASK=off` stops the asking altogether.
- **A client that cannot ask** is told once that the note waits for the person's own `magnemo yes`.
- The first-run paste ends at a restart: the tools load when the client starts, and the first memory is approved
  in the chat. docs/MCP.md has the table of clients, with what was seen.
- The server now answers a protocol revision it does not speak with the newest it does (2025-11-25), not an echo.
- **Breaking, and on purpose: a `magnemo yes` that an agent or a script ran in 0.6.7 is refused in 0.6.8 (exit 3).**
  If a pipeline, a hook or an agent's shell runs `magnemo yes`, `no`, `clear` or `promote` for you, it now stops with
  one line and writes nothing to memory. The yes is yours: type it in a terminal.
- **What the engine checks.** `magnemo yes` (and `no`, `clear`, `promote`, their long forms `reject` and `cleartaint`,
  and the answers inside `review`) requires an interactive terminal (a TTY on stdin) and a name in the vault's
  `trust.humans`. It refuses with no TTY (an agent's tool call, a script, a pipe), with `MAGNEMO_AGENT` set, from inside
  an MCP server session, or for a `--by` that is not on the list (never defaulted). With no `--by`, the first listed
  name is used.
- **A refusal names its gate and the route.** With no terminal: `This yes is yours. Type it yourself in a terminal:
  magnemo yes <id>`. The other refusals say which gate (a seat named, an unlisted name, an MCP session) and end with
  the same route. Each refusal is one line in the trust ledger (`judgment.refused`, `catch: yes-check`,
  `ran_by: refused:<reason>`). Every yes, no and clear that goes through carries `ran_by: terminal`.
- **One override, for a relayed word:** `MAGNEMO_YES_RELAY=<listed name>`, on a terminal only and for that name only;
  the ledger says `ran_by: relay:<who ran it>`, so a relay is never read as the person's own hand.
- **What it is not.** A check on the hand, not a credential: a process that allocates its own TTY, clears
  `MAGNEMO_AGENT` and names a listed person passes. KNOWN_LIMITS.md says so first. Promotion is still not an MCP tool.
- The registry description no longer says "zero network calls": "Governed memory for AI agents, in plain local files.
  No network calls of its own."

## 0.6.7 — THE POLISH, SECOND PASS
- **`magnemo review` says HELD and TAINTED.** A note Sentinel is holding is labelled before its text, the text of a
  flagged note is shown quoted, and there is no `[p]` for it: "held by Sentinel — `magnemo clear <id>` first". The
  terminal now matches what `magnemo yes` already did in 0.6.6.
- **A yes or a no from `review` is on the record like every other:** the ledger line carries `ran_by` and a reason.
- **A note Sentinel caught earns its author no trust.** A secret or an instruction-shaped line that you read, cleared
  and kept becomes canon; the `trust.event success` a promotion gives its author is not written for it.
- **The ALERT is scored when it is staged and is read first.** No more "unscored — run: cli rescore"; Sentinel's
  notices lead the review queue. The inbox door's and the chest's notices are scored too. It says "an MCP stage".
- README: for a desktop-only Mac, where the app keeps its own `claude`.

## 0.6.6 — THE POLISH
- **No traceback reaches a person.** `magnemo stage` with a store the partition does not have answers in one line naming
  the partition's stores (and checks before anything is written, Sentinel's notice included); an unknown partition names
  the vault's partitions; a missing `--file` says so. An id no note matches is one line on `show`, `yes`, `no`, `clear`,
  `promote`, `reject` and `flag`. `magnemo review` without a terminal says "review needs a terminal; use `magnemo yes
  <id>` / `magnemo no <id>`" and lists what waits by short id. Anything else that fails prints `magnemo: <one line>`;
  `MAGNEMO_DEBUG=1` shows the trace.
- **The short id works everywhere.** The eight characters `stage` prints (`magnemo yes 17f26148`) are now taken by
  `show`, `clear` and `cleartaint` as well as `yes` and `no`, for staged and canonical notes; two matches are listed.
- **`yes` waits for `clear`.** `magnemo yes <id>`, `magnemo promote` and `review`'s [p] refuse a tainted or held note in
  a sentence — "TAINTED — read it, then clear it: magnemo clear <id> --reason …" — until a keyholder has cleared it.
  `yes --all` skips them and counts them. A Sentinel ALERT is a notice, not a memory, and carries no taint of its own:
  `yes --all` and a bare `yes` skip it and count it; you keep one by naming it (`magnemo yes <id>`) or drop it
  (`magnemo no <id> --reason …`). A kept alert is served and wakes in the boot pack; the pack says how many notes
  Sentinel is holding.
- **`magnemo stage --help` shows one real example**, with a partition, a store and a source, and says what a new vault's
  stores are.

## 0.6.4.post1 — THE DIRECTORY RELEASE
- Registry name + privacy section + SECURITY.md. No engine change: the MCP registry name moves to our own domain
  (`mcp-name: ai.magnemo/magnemo`), the README gains a Privacy section, `SECURITY.md` says how to report, and the
  Claude Desktop bundle names its privacy page. A post-release in PyPI's own sense: metadata only.

## 0.6.5 — SENTINEL AT THE GATE
- **The stage door is swept.** Every note staged through the MCP `stage` tool or the CLI's `magnemo stage` passes Sentinel,
  the same sweep the inbox, the Room and the chest already ran: a secret-shaped value never lands (the note carries the
  redaction line and a `sentinel:secret:<pattern>` taint; the reply says HELD and names the pattern, never the value); an
  instruction-shaped line stages TAINTED beside a Sentinel ALERT note. Four doors, one sweep.
- **A tainted note is never served to an agent** — not by `retrieve`, not in the boot pack's digest — until a keyholder
  reads it and clears it: `magnemo clear <id> --reason …` (the short name for `cleartaint`; ledgered).
- **`magnemo doctor` checks the network sentence** instead of the README asserting it: `network: transport stdio ·
  listener none · outbound modules none` from a static scan of the installed package, FAIL if a network module appears; and
  `server: never connected` until an MCP client has actually started this vault's server (the server now logs each session
  start to `_ledger/connections.jsonl`) — the CLI answering is not the server connecting.
- The one paste's step 6 keeps the same-session read and gets the restart back: approve, `magnemo bootpack`, then restart
  so the memory mounts for every later session. The CLI's stage reply names the word (`magnemo yes <id>`).
- The companion `magnemo-mcp` says `requires-python >=3.11`, the same as the engine it pins; docs/MCP.md says 3.11 too.

## 0.6.4 — THE WORDS
- The engine tells the truth about Python: `requires-python` is `>=3.11`, as the README, the site and the paste
  already say. `pip install` on 3.10 now refuses with the standard message.
- Found by running the suite on 3.11: a vault path given AFTER flags (`magnemo promote <id> --by NAME <vault>`,
  `magnemo stage … <vault>`) was rejected as an unrecognized argument on Python 3.11 (3.12+ parsed it). The CLI now
  reads one leftover word as the vault on every supported Python.
- The words: every sentence a reader meets — the README, the docs, this file, the CLI's help and messages, the MCP
  door's replies, the boot pack, the vault's own README — now says "you", "a person" or "the keyholder". The door's
  refusal reads "an agent seat cannot sign as a keyholder"; the stage reply reads "Awaits KEYHOLDER review"; the caps
  read "keyholder-only". Words only: the config key `trust.humans`, every identifier, ledger field, file format, tool
  name and the rule itself (promotion and publish are never an agent's) are unchanged.
- `magnemo --version` prints the version (it was missing; the release drill asked for it).

## 0.6.3 — THE BLOCK, TRUE TO ITS OWN LAW
The block does what the record says it does. Found by a second agent on a second
machine, told only "you are the first user, run the protocol" (credit: cc-2, whose
patch against the 0.6.1 sdist was the design; re-implemented on main).
- PROVENANCE ENFORCED AT THE DOOR: the `stage` tool's author is the server's seat
  (`MAGNEMO_AGENT`), always. A seat that tries to sign as a keyholder (a name in
  `trust.humans`) is refused with a plain reply and the refusal is ledgered as a
  `stage` denial; a different non-keyholder name is kept in the new provenance field
  `claimed_author` (appended; nothing renamed).
- THE GATE LIFT IS A WORD: `magnemo yes` promotes the top of the queue (the order
  `review` shows), `yes <id-fragment>` one note (two matches = refuse and list),
  `yes --all` the whole queue with one ledger entry per note; `magnemo no <fragment>
  --reason TXT` rejects one (the reason stays required). `--by` defaults to the first
  keyholder; `--reason` to "approved in chat". Every entry these verbs write carries
  `ran_by` — the agent seat if `MAGNEMO_AGENT` is set, else `terminal`: the yes is
  yours, the hand that ran it is on the record. `promote`/`reject` are unchanged
  (the long form). Promotion is still never an MCP tool: the four tools stay four.
- THE RECORD TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT ITSELF: the MCP boot line reports `queue=<n>` (and
  `held=<n>`), as the docs always said; the `stage` reply and the `review` footer name
  the word (`magnemo yes`); the README's install line carries the uv fallback the site
  paste has (Python 3.11+; `uv tool install magnemo` if pip can't).
- THE OPERATOR FLAG, deterministic: a note staged by a keyholder's own hand (the author is a
  keyholder) carries the operator tag automatically; no text sniffing.
No change to gates, action classes, the L1 cap, trust weights, half-life, the ledger's
fields (one appended), the vault layout, config keys, the four tool names, or the boot
pack of an unchanged vault.

## 0.6.2 — THE PUBLIC FACE (metadata release; no engine change) — built Sep 10, pre-flighted, not released
Public face + registry metadata; no engine change. The wheel's code is byte-for-byte
the 0.6.1 engine plus the words strangers read first.
- README opens in plain words: the ladder line, the receipt line, the one paste
  (the same paste as magnemo.ai, verbatim), then the builder's paragraph.
- PyPI summary: "Governed memory for AI agents. Memory with receipts." Project URLs
  (homepage, source, docs, changelog). Source points at github.com/magnemo-ai/magnemo,
  which lights on Source Day.
- MCP tool metadata: plain titles and annotations on the four tools (retrieve and
  bootpack are read-only; nothing is destructive). Registry name
  `io.github.magnemo-ai/magnemo` declared in the README.
- Companion distribution `magnemo-mcp` (metadata only: depends on magnemo, exposes
  the `magnemo-mcp` entry point) so `uvx magnemo-mcp` and the MCP registry's
  `pypi` package resolve to the server directly.
- Order codes and register numbers left this changelog; the words stay.

## 0.6.1 — THE FRONT DOOR
The one-paste install, battle-tested on a machine that never heard of us.
- THE GUARD: `magnemo guard <vault>` makes every canonical note and
  rendered file owner-immutable at the OS level (macOS chflags uchg; Linux chmod,
  advisory), gives agents a writable work/ beside the vault, and writes the
  body's deny rules into the repo's .claude/settings.json; `guard --off` is a
  keyholder's verb, ledgered. Supersession everywhere: renders archive the prior bytes
  (_index/archive), deleted renders are re-rendered by doctor, and
  `magnemo restore <path|id> [--to <version>]` brings a version back in one
  command. Sentinel's injection patterns (S1–S13) are shared by rooms and the
  inbox: an instruction-shaped drop is staged tainted with an alert note.
- THE ROOM v0: magnemo room open|say|connect|separate|watch|close|replay|list —
  agents talk in a room a person keeps open; every message is a STAGED note with
  provenance (from_seat, to, class, salience); Sentinel sweeps on stage (secret
  formats + 12 injection patterns); taint is hereditary through replies;
  connect/separate/close are the keyholder's verbs; the keyholder's seat is never removable; a
  closed room replays from its ledger alone. A message may propose, never promote.
- THE SUBSCRIPTION SOCKET v0: magnemo run "<task>" --engine claude runs an
  Agent SDK session through your own Claude login (the sanctioned door; no token is
  ever stored, no key of ours exists) with the vault mounted through the four
  verbs; every action staged with provenance; the FUEL line prints usage and the
  plan-window signal; cap exits say why. --schedule writes a plain-speech RAIL.md
  row and installs a launchd/cron job; --card = runs · tokens · API list-price
  avoided. codex/gemini refuse with "not wired yet". Optional extra: magnemo[claude].
- THE BOARDROOM MOUNT: a vault now declares its own shape
  (`partitions`, `scopes`); promotion can render a note to disk with the
  prior file hash ledgered (`render`); `doctor` re-stages hand edits to
  rendered files as founder drift; `magnemo inbox` is a staging door with
  Sentinel at it; `bootpack.excerpts` lift sections from canon; `handoff
  --body-file`. Engine writers follow the vault's shape. No new MCP tool.
- THE LAST DEAD NAME: the environment variables are MAGNEMO_VAULT,
  MAGNEMO_AGENT, MAGNEMO_SCOPE, MAGNEMO_PARTITIONS. **MEMOS_\* honored through
  0.6.x; removed in 0.7** — if a MAGNEMO_* name is unset and its MEMOS_* twin
  is set, the old value is used silently (one mapping, in `magnemo.config`);
  `magnemo doctor` prints one plain line naming any MEMOS_* still in use.
  Internal register numbers no longer appear in the README or docs.
- THE CHEST ("machines die, the memory doesn't"):
  `magnemo chest add|status|push|tick` conducts copies of the vault to up to
  two places you own (a git remote, a folder) on events — promote, receipt,
  handoff, N staged notes, a 24h ceiling — swept by Sentinel before every
  push (any secret-shaped hit blocks the push, stages a note naming file +
  pattern, never the value). `magnemo mount --from <git|dir>` restores a
  vault: fetch, verify the hash-chained ledger (broken chain refused), doctor,
  boot pack — byte-identical to the source's. Two drifted vaults reconverge
  through staging (foreign canon → proposals, `chest:merge from <label>`;
  ledgers unioned with a CHEST_MERGE marker); canon is never overwritten.
  Gauge line in `doctor` and the boot pack header. No hosted destination
  exists in code. No new MCP tool — the four-verb server stays four.
- PUBLIC FACE HYGIENE: license is Apache-2.0 in the metadata, with
  LICENSE and NOTICE shipped inside the wheel and sdist.
- `mnemosyneos` shim removed.
- ONE server: the legacy five-tool `magnemo-server` console script and
  `magnemo.server` are removed; `magnemo-mcp` (retrieve / stage / bootpack /
  handoff) is the only server. Its stdio plumbing lives in `magnemo.transport`.
- ONE version: `__version__` is read from `pyproject.toml` (source) or package
  metadata (installed) — never a second hand-typed string.
- Front door is Magnemo only: internal character names no longer appear on the
  public face (README, package metadata, docstrings, mount banner).
- NEW `magnemo mount`: registers the MCP server in the project's `.mcp.json`
  itself — absolute vault path, venv-pinned command, merge-never-clobber. The
  step nobody has to guess anymore.
- `magnemo doctor` auto-checks `.mcp.json` when present, and now catches the
  configs that would kill the server at boot (invalid MEMOS_SCOPE, missing
  MEMOS_VAULT) BEFORE your agent trips on them. Agent-environment-dependent
  findings (PATH, ${var} paths) are warnings, not failures.
- A stray file in `_staging` (a .DS_Store, a hand-made note without
  frontmatter) no longer bricks the MCP server at boot — skipped with a
  warning, per file, never silently.
- `python3 -m magnemo` now works — the PATH-failure fallback every agent
  reaches for.
- MEMOS_SCOPE rejection message now names the valid partitions and the fix.
- `magnemo init` prints the two next commands; server identity reports the
  real version (was frozen at 0.5.0).


## 0.6.0 — OPEN BETA — 2026-08-29
Same build as 0.6.0b1, re-versioned without the pre-release marker: pip
prefers stable versions, so the b1 was shadowed by the 0.0.1 name-holder for
anyone running a plain `pip install magnemo`. Beta honesty lives where it
belongs — the 0.x version line, KNOWN_LIMITS.md, and "open beta" on the site.

## 0.6.0b1 — superseded same day — 2026-08-29
The engine goes public: `pip install magnemo` becomes true for everyone.
- First functional release published to PyPI, replacing the 0.0.1 name-holder
  stub. Beta-marked version; the source repo remains private until launch.
- README rebuilt around the stranger's quickstart: install → init → mount →
  first bootpack → doctor, using the installed `magnemo` / `magnemo-mcp`
  entry points end to end.
- **KNOWN_LIMITS.md** added — the honest beta caveats list, shipped in the
  package where a stranger will actually read it.
- Engine code is 0.5.1's, unchanged: the release is the door, not the rooms.

## 0.5.1 — dogfood QoL — 2026-08-24
Customer zero's first friction batch, all four notes answered:
- **`magnemo stage`** — the founder's terminal write path. Same gate as agents
  (`Governance.agent_write`): provenance `--source` mandatory, lands in
  `_staging/` only, KAIROS-scored, duplicate-flagged, Foresight-logged
  (`via: cli`). Body via `--body`, `--file`, or stdin.
- **`magnemo doctor`** — the rename survivor's checkup. Validates python/venv,
  vault reachability + partition/special dirs + writability, config load,
  ledger JSONL integrity, and any `--mount .mcp.json` (command exists,
  `MEMOS_VAULT` reachable). Read-only; exit 1 on any FAIL. Born from the
  mnemosyne→magnemo rename that silently broke every absolute path.
- Fresh-vault bootpack no longer prints the raw epoch ("ledger time
  1970-01-01…"); an empty ledger renders as "before any ledger event (fresh
  vault)". `trust.EPOCH` names the sentinel; determinism unchanged.
- `dist/pypi` rebuilt at the current version (stale 0.0.1 artifacts removed).
  PyPI keeps the 0.0.1 stub until launch; local dist serves dogfood installs.

## 0.5.0 — "First Trust" — 2026-08-22
**The trust ledger is math.** Computed Autonomy, four blocks, merged under
founder authorization. Backfilled merge-code successes for earlier pull requests; `claude-worker` reads
effective L2 SUPERVISED in merge-code under G0001.
- **B1 · Trust ledger math** (`magnemo/trust.py`, docs/TRUST.md). Five action classes
  (read · stage · merge-code · promote-canon · publish), five levels (L0 frozen → L4
  keyholder). Score = Σ weight × 0.5^(age/half-life) over append-only ledger events after
  the latest violation; thresholds → level; class floors/ceilings; `promote-canon` and
  `publish` hard-capped at L1 for everyone but keyholders, in code. One `violation` resets and
  freezes the class; only a keyholder `reinstate` lifts it. New verbs: `magnemo autonomy
  <actor>` (scorecard), `magnemo trust record|events`. Derived events: promote → success,
  reject → failure (author, `stage`); MCP partition-wall hit → denied. `TrustLedger.record`
  accepts `ts=` and extra keys; the six base keys are unchanged. Config: `trust` block.
- **B2 · Grants as data** (`magnemo/grants.py`, docs/GRANTS.md). `trust.grant` ledger
  records: grantee, classes, level, scope, conditions, kind (standing | one-time), ref,
  expires, grantor; revocation is a second record. Keyholder-only verbs `magnemo grant` /
  `magnemo revoke`; `magnemo grants` shows state (active · revoked · expired · consumed ·
  pending). `effective = min(computed, granted)`; keyholder-only classes and L4 refused at
  issue AND clamped at compute. One-time grants are consumed by the trust event that cites
  them (`trust record … --grant G0001`). **Genesis grant G0001** on record.
- **B3 · The Gate Map** (`magnemo/gates.py`, docs/GATES.md). Six default
  gates in config (`trust.gates`): retrieve · staging · main · gate-code · canon · publish.
  State derived from the grant ledger at `as_of`: `computed` gates read delegated/locked;
  locked and open gates never move by grant; keyholder-only gates cannot be opened by config.
  `magnemo gates [--as-of] [--json]`. Boot pack gains `## GATES` after the Charter,
  rendered at ledger time (pure). LEDGER TAIL count unchanged.
- **B4 · The agent always knows its own level.** `bootpack.generate(..., actor=)` adds
  `## YOUR AUTONOMY — <actor>` after GATES: effective/computed/granted/score per class, active
  grants, FROZEN classes shouted, at ledger time. CLI `bootpack --actor A` (default
  `$MEMOS_AGENT`); MCP `bootpack` always passes `MEMOS_AGENT`. `handoff.record` stores
  `levels` on the ledger entry and in the staged note; LAST HANDOFF renders "autonomy at the
  boundary". Packs for different actors differ only in their own section (tested).

## 0.4.0 — "First Name" — 2026-08-21
**The product is named: Magnemo.** Ratified by the boardroom 2026-08-20 after the full
The name collision gauntlet (PyPI · npm · GitHub · SERP clear; USPTO + CIPO zero hits,
live and dead; magnemo.ai / magnemo.io secured).

- Python package renamed `mnemosyneos` → `magnemo`. All imports, entry points
  (`magnemo`, `magnemo-mcp`, `magnemo-server`), and `python -m magnemo.cli`.
- MCP server identity → `magnemo`. The four tools (`retrieve`, `stage`, `bootpack`,
  `handoff`) and their contracts are unchanged.
- `mnemosyneos` remains as a thin deprecation shim for this release only (removed in 0.5).
- Vault config file is now `_config/magnemo.json`; vaults still carrying
  `_config/mnemosyneos.json` are read transparently (write path always targets the new name).
- `MEMOS_*` environment variables are unchanged — they are the live mount contract.
- The persona **Mnemosyne** keeps her name wherever she is the persona. Historical vault notes
  keep their original wording; history is provenance.

Earlier in 0.4.0 (pre-rename): the four-verb MCP server, cross-session mount gate.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-20
salience v1 · Boot Pack + Charter · Boundary Telemetry · Foresight counters.

## 0.2.0
Package `memos` → `mnemosyneos`; Telos sockets (consequence, taint, token budgets).

---

# The README's history sections
Moved here from the README on Sep 24, 2026 (P-71): the release-by-release notes it carried as "New in" sections, verbatim.

## Quick start (open beta)
Five minutes from install to a governed, booted agent. Python 3.11+, zero dependencies.

```bash
# 1 · install — needs Python 3.11 or newer; if pip can't find it, install uv and run: uv tool install magnemo
pip install magnemo

# 2 · create a vault — plain markdown you own; read it in any editor
magnemo init ./vault

# 3 · mount it into your agent (Claude Code / any MCP client) — .mcp.json:
#   {"mcpServers":{"magnemo":{
#     "command":"magnemo-mcp",
#     "env":{"MAGNEMO_VAULT":"/absolute/path/to/vault",
#            "MAGNEMO_AGENT":"my-agent",
#            "MAGNEMO_SCOPE":"ops,shared",
#            "MAGNEMO_PARTITIONS":"ops,shared"}}}}
#   (full tool reference and postures: docs/MCP.md)

# 4 · render the first boot pack — what a fresh session wakes up knowing
magnemo bootpack --stdout

# 5 · checkup — python, vault, config, ledger, and your .mcp.json mount
magnemo doctor --mount .mcp.json
```

Then the loop begins: agents write to staging, you review.
```bash
magnemo yes             # the gate lift is a word: promote the top of the queue (yes <id-fragment> · yes --all)
magnemo no <id> --reason "…"   # reject one — the reason is required; rejections teach
magnemo review          # the interactive queue, when you want to read first
magnemo ledger          # every decision, forever
```
Beta honesty: read [KNOWN_LIMITS.md](KNOWN_LIMITS.md) before you rely on it.

## New in v0.2 — the consequence sockets (consequence, taint, token budgets)
- **Retrieval receipts**: every search returns a `rid` and logs which notes it
  served (`_ledger/retrievals.jsonl`) plus the payload size in chars.
- **Outcome recording** (`magnemo outcome <rid> approved|denied --by NAME`): links
  an action's result back to the memories that informed it. Each note accrues
  `yield_w / yield_l` — an earned track record — and **ranking multiplies by
  proven yield**. Memory that pays ranks up; memory that misleads sinks.
- **Taint propagation**: writes from untrusted sources carry `taint:` in
  frontmatter; taint is **hereditary** through supersession and only a keyholder
  clears it (`magnemo cleartaint`). Injection cannot launder itself through
  derivation, and tainted notes are rank-penalized and excludable.
- **Char budgets**: `retrieve(budget=…)` bounds every payload; payload
  size is measured and logged on every retrieval — the instrumentation for the
  token-efficiency benchmark is on by default from day one.

## New in v0.3 — salience-sorted review — so you read what mattered first
The founder's attention is the scarcest resource in the loop. Every staged
note now gets a **deterministic salience score at stage time** — no model
calls, no embeddings — stored in frontmatter (`salience` +
`salience_components`) so the ranking is auditable from the file alone:

- **consequence** — the writer's declared impact class
  (security > money > correctness > process > info, via `stage(impact=…)`)
- **novelty** — trigram/tag overlap vs existing canon in the same partition;
  duplicates of settled truth sink, new claims rise
- **operator signal** — `cli flag <note-id> --by NAME`; by config invariant a
  founder-flagged note outranks *any* unflagged note
- **source weight** — audit/postmortem findings outrank routine runs

`cli review` presents the queue salience-descending with score + components,
capped per pass (`--batch N`, default from config), and reports queue depth
up front; the MCP server reports queue depth at session start. `cli rescore`
backfills legacy notes. Weights live in the vault's documented config file —
see [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).

## New in v0.3 — the Boot Pack: served on every wake — the agent never starts from nothing
```bash
python -m magnemo.cli bootpack [--scope dev|ops|shared] [--class worker|partner]
```
One command renders `BOOT_PACK.md` — the orientation a fresh session boots
from. Section order is doctrine, for both classes: **(1) the Charter,
verbatim, always first** (an explicit placeholder if not yet promoted — the
Charter is never fabricated); (2) canon digest — every canonical note's
title, one-line summary, and stable path; (3) open threads, staged count,
and the top-5 staged notes by salience; (4) trust-ledger tail.

`--class partner` additionally serves a **RELATIONSHIP LAYER** sourced from
a codex file (voice/lore/relationship — what makes a spawn a partner, not a
clone). Worker boots omit it and stay lean. No codex file, no section: a
partner boot degrades gracefully. The codex source is a pluggable seam —
see [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).

The pack is **deterministic**: a pure function of vault state — identical
state yields identical bytes, per class (tested).

## New in v0.3 — Boundary Telemetry — every handoff records where it stopped and why
```bash
python -m magnemo.cli handoff --usage 91 --trigger planned --cut "deferred X" --by NAME
python -m magnemo.cli handoff --report     # every boundary ever, as a table
```
Sessions end at boundaries — the context wall, a planned stop, a compaction —
and untracked boundaries are where continuity silently dies. Each `handoff`
appends a structured telemetry entry to `_ledger/handoffs.jsonl`
(**append-only**: usage %, trigger, what was cut, actor) *and* stages a
provenance-complete handoff note for review like any other memory candidate.
Known historical boundaries can be recorded honestly with `--when`: the entry
keeps both `ts` (when the boundary happened) and `recorded_at` (when it was
written down).

**The ~90% soft-threshold doctrine.** Don't ride to the wall. At ~90% context
usage, write the handoff and stand down — a handoff written *at* the wall is
written in a panic with no room to verify the catch. The first recorded
datum is the scar that set the rule: **Aug 13 2026, 98% usage, trigger=wall**
(operator-confirmed). Everything after ~90% should be boundary work, not new
work; the telemetry exists so the doctrine gets numbers instead of vibes.

## New in v0.3 — Foresight counters — what memory costs, measured from day one
```bash
python -m magnemo.cli costs      # per-kind payload costs + the stated baseline
```
Every memory payload served — a retrieval result set, a boot pack — logs an
append-only event to `_ledger/costs.jsonl`: bytes plus a rough token
estimate (bytes/4, documented, swappable for a real tokenizer later).
`cli costs` summarizes per kind and **states the measured baseline** — the
number every future payload optimization (renditions, pointers, adaptive
resolution) gets judged against. First datum: a full worker boot of this
repo's vault costs ~465 tokens. A failed counter never fails the retrieval
it was measuring.

## v0.5.0 "First Trust" — the trust ledger is math

Every actor holds a computed autonomy level per action class (read · stage · merge-code ·
promote-canon · publish), derived only from append-only ledger events: `score = Σ weight ×
0.5^(age/half-life)`, thresholds → L0 frozen … L3 autonomous; L4 keyholder is held by people,
never computed. Grants are ledger records (`magnemo grant`) — a standing order becomes a grant id, so permission is data with a receipt — and the Gate Map
(`magnemo gates`) plus your own scorecard ride every boot pack. `promote-canon` and `publish`
stay keyholder-only forever. Read `docs/TRUST.md`, `docs/GRANTS.md`, `docs/GATES.md`.

## v0.4.0 "First Name" — the product is Magnemo
Ratified 2026-08-20 after the naming gauntlet. Package `magnemo`; CLI `python -m magnemo.cli`
(or `magnemo`); MCP server `magnemo-mcp`. The previous package name is retired.
Full notes: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## New in v0.4 — the four-tool MCP server — the whole agent surface, nothing more
`python -m magnemo.mcp` (or `magnemo-mcp`) exposes **exactly four tools**, each
bound to existing code — `retrieve` · `stage` · `bootpack` · `handoff`. Promotion is not
a tool — promotion is your act, always. Zero deps, stdio, stdlib only.

```
retrieve ─▶ scope gate ─▶ walled BM25 ─▶ budget/rendition (snippet→pointer) ─▶ cost event
stage    ─▶ provenance check ─▶ dup flag ─▶ salience ─▶ _staging/ ─▶ cost event
bootpack ─▶ Charter ─▶ digest ─▶ salience-ranked queue ─▶ LAST HANDOFF ─▶ ledger tail
handoff  ─▶ handoffs.jsonl ─▶ staged note ─▶ next bootpack inherits it
```

Tested invariants: staging is the only write path · provenance mandatory · scope walls
(`MAGNEMO_SCOPE`) · budgets cap payloads with logged truncation · free tier · least privilege.
Three postures (native / mount-and-govern / gateway), full tool reference and cascade
diagrams: **[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md)**. `magnemo-mcp` is the only server.

## The chest — machines die, the memory doesn't
```bash
magnemo chest add git <url-you-own> --label laptop     # Copy B
magnemo chest add path /Volumes/Drawer/vault --label drawer   # Copy C
magnemo chest push                                     # swept for secrets first, every time
magnemo mount --from <url-or-dir> ./vault              # restore onto a new machine
```
Magnemo *conducts* copies to places you own; it never *holds* them. Full
contract: [docs/CHEST.md](docs/CHEST.md).

## Designed-in evolution (do not remove these seams)
- `strength` field + score hook in `search.py` → Phase 2 reinforcement/decay.
- `TrustLedger.pass_rate()` → the L0→L3 graduation math.
- `Index.search()` signature is stable → embedding retrieval swaps in behind it.
- Consolidation/reflection jobs write through `Governance.agent_write` like any
  agent — the sleep cycle inherits the review queue for free.
